##Summary

EtherMate does not collect any personal data. Scanned QR Codes and Ethereum Public Wallet Addresses may be stored locally on the device but these are never stored offsite by EtherMate.

##Mode and place of processing the Data

Stored Wallet addresses are used to acces various API's and pull in basic wallet information such as wallet value (in a local set currency) and wallet coin holdings.

##Device permissions for Personal Data access
Depending on the User's specific device, this Application may request certain permissions that allow it to access the User's device Data as described below.

In order to revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device settings or contact EtherMate for support at the contact details provided in the present document.
The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may be dependent on the User's device and software.

##Changes to this privacy policy
The Data Controller reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time by giving notice to its Users on this page. It is strongly recommended to check this page often, referring to the date of the last modification listed at the bottom. If a User objects to any of the changes to the Policy, the User must cease using this Application and can request that the Data Controller remove the Personal Data.
